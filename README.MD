# IRC-COMMIT-BOT (FORKED)

This project is forked from https://github.com/avail/irc-commit-bot

There have been/will be *many* changes to the codebase, primarily with a GitHub-leaning bent (Gitlab? whats gitlab?).

I may submit a PR back upstream at some point, but we'll have to see.

#### Contributing

This code is currently live in production in a couple of places, with auto-deploy webhooks set up. 
Because of this (and until we are out of dev), please direct any Pull Requests at the 'dev' branch. Once merged into 'master' auto-updates happen.

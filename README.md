now, the original readme.....

# IRC COMMIT BOT

I literally couldn't find anything like this, it's probably just me being bad though.

Made something better? Fork the repository and submit a pull request!

# USAGE

```npm install```

`nano main.js` and modify stuff from the config var to your likings, everything else can stay default.

`nodejs main.js` to run the bot.

Add a new Web Hook to whatever repository you want to track, with the bot's URL, e.g http://getrektby.us:4021/git.json

Enjoy an influx of spam as people commit to the repository!
